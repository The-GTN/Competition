## Explanations

If you're reading that, you've been granted to access to our OOD projects.
Use the clone option of this OOD folder and create a local folder, if it's not already done.

Open a shell from this local folder, the **git pull** command is recommended for each times you come back to this work.

From the root of this work folder, in a shell, you could use these differents commands :

* **make** : run the `executable` of this project
* **make comp** : build the differents `classes`
* **make compTest** : build the `testing classes`
* **make doc** : create the `documentation`
* **make test** : make the differents `tests`
* **make extract** : extract the classes from the `.jar` files
* **make exe** : create the `executables`
* **make competition args="c n"** : run the `executable` of this project
* **make clean** : delete all the `.class` files, the `docs` folder and the extracted files created with `make extract`

## 'make competition' : Use message

    run with make competition args = "c n"
    where:
    c       = the type of Competition you use (here "t" for Tournament or "l" for League)
    n       = the number of Competitors who participate in the Competition (a power of 2 if you selected the Tournament)
    try:
    make competition args="l 3"
    or
    make competition args="t 4"

## Update Master

Find [here](media/competitionsV2.pdf "Update Projet") the new version of the subject.

## 'make competition' : update message

    run with make competition args = "c n g m"
    where:
    c            = the type of Competition you use (here "t" for Tournament or "l" for League)
    n            = the number of Competitors who participate in the Competition (a power of 2 if you selected the Tournament)
    g [if c = m] = the number of groups (for Master)
    m [if c = m] = the number of members per groups (for Master)
    warning for using Master:
    m = g*m and there at least one valid filter for this numbers n g and m
    try:
    make competition args="l 3"
    or
    make competition args="t 4"
    or
    make competition args="m 8 2 4"
